## 📄 Increase average check
Based on the data analysis, suggest two ways to increase the average check. 
## 📊 Solution
1. Hypothesis: If we offer additional items to customers, the average check will increase.
Steps for testing:
- Analyze high demand items and identify related products.
- Add a “Frequently bought together” block on the order page.
- Create bundles of discounted items, incentivizing the customer to spend more.
- Run an A/B test of different recommendations and evaluate the impact on the average check.

2. Hypothesis: If you offer customers bonuses (e.g. free shipping, discount, gifts) when they reach a certain order amount, they will take more items to increase the purchase amount and get the bonus.
Steps to test:
- Analyze current average checks and determine a value that is slightly higher than the average check.
- Offer a bonus when ordering from a certain amount.
- Add an indicator “Add X more rubles to get bonus/free shipping” in the cart.
- A/B-test: check customer conversion at different bonus thresholds.

## 📄 Customer Retention
Develop a retention strategy for customers who have made only one order. Evaluate which product categories can be offered to these customers to increase their repeat purchases.
## 📊 Solution
1- Analyze customers who have made only one order
- Determine the time period after which a customer does not usually return
- Determine the category of products after which customers do not return.

2. Personalized offers
- Offer the customer products related to their first purchase:
	- accessories: after buying a laptop - offer cases, mouse, software subscription;
	- consumables: after buying a printer - remind about ink/paper after N days.
- Analyze similar customers
Offer items that other customers have frequently bought after a similar purchase.

3. Offer a bonus (discount, gift, reward points) for a repeat order
- Personalized mailings/push notifications/SMS 
	- after 7 days - with a review and a bonus for a repeat order;
	- after 30 days: reminder of the offer with bonus points.
